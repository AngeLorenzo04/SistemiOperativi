# Operating Systems - Exam Practice Repository

This repository contains a collection of exercises created while preparing for the *Operating Systems* exam taught by **Prof. Letizia Leonardi** at the **University of Modena and Reggio Emilia (UNIMORE)**, within the **Computer Engineering** program.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**:  
> This repository is not intended for teaching or instructional purposes.  
> It is a personal archive of exercises developed while studying for the exam.

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure

# üìå How to Add a Code Snippet in Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) allows you to create **custom code snippets** to speed up repetitive coding tasks. This guide will walk you through the steps to add your own snippets.

## üîß What is a Snippet?

A snippet is a code template you can trigger with a keyword (`prefix`). It helps you avoid writing the same code repeatedly by expanding a shortcut into a full block of code.

## ü™õ Steps to Add a Snippet

### 1. Open the Snippet Configuration

1. Open **VS Code**.
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS).
3. Search and select: `Preferences: Configure User Snippets`.

### 2. Choose the Snippet File

- You can choose to:
  - Add a snippet for a **specific language** (e.g. `javascript.json`, `python.json`, etc.)
  - Use `global.code-snippets` to make the snippet available in **all languages**.

### 3. Add Your Snippet
 - You will find the snippet in the folder snippets
    - linguages used are `shellscript` `makefile` `C`
